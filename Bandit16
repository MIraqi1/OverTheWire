This one was a bit challenging because I do not like using vim and sure i couldve used nano but i thought it would be better to challenge myself with vim 

Essentially you run 'nmap localhost -p31000-32000' to check which ports are open 
Then you run 'cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit16 | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31518 -ign_eof' on each of those ports until you find one that is speaking SSL
Finally you find the correct port and you are given an RSA private key, now i have worked with RSA keys before in my crypto class so i knew how to handle it
You save the RSA key in a file and chmod 400 the file changing the permissions so only we can read it (private key things)

Finally you run the normal command to get into the next level but this time you -i the file you saved in this case bandit17.key and you are IN!

This one was fun because once you used the diff command between passwords.old and passwords.new you can see the password for level 18 

BUT once you try to SSH into level 18, it immediately gets terminated because of the bashrc file which probably tells the session to terminate once someone ssh into it
a quick work around is to add cat readme to the end of the ssh and it will spit out a new password for level19 

ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat readme"
